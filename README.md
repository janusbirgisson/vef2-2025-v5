## How to use

### Quick start

1. [Create an account on DatoCMS](https://datocms.com).

2. Make sure that you have set up the [Github integration on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/git/vercel-for-github).

3. Let DatoCMS set everything up for you clicking this button below:

[![Deploy with DatoCMS](https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy?repo=datocms%2Fnextjs-starter-kit%3Amain)

### Local setup

Once the setup of the project and repo is done, clone the repo locally.

#### Set up environment variables

Copy the sample .env file:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

In your DatoCMS' project, go to the **Settings** menu at the top and click **API tokens**.

Copy the values of the following tokens into the specified environment variable:

- `DATOCMS_PUBLISHED_CONTENT_CDA_TOKEN`: CDA Only (Published)
- `DATOCMS_DRAFT_CONTENT_CDA_TOKEN`: CDA Only (Draft)
- `DATOCMS_CMA_TOKEN`: CMA Only (Admin)

Then set `SECRET_API_TOKEN` as a sicure string (you can use `openssl rand -hex 32` or any other cryptographically-secure random string generator). It will be used to safeguard all route handlers from incoming requests from untrusted sources:

#### Run your project locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your website should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

## VS Code

It is highly recommended to follow [these instructions](https://gql-tada.0no.co/get-started/installation#vscode-setup) for an optimal experience with Visual Studio Code, including features like diagnostics, auto-completions, and type hovers for GraphQL.

## Updating the GraphQL schema

When the DatoCMS schema, which includes various models and fields, undergoes any updates or modifications, it is essential to ensure that these changes are properly reflected in your local development environment. To accomplish this, you should locally run the following command:

```
npm run generate-schema
```

Executing this task will automatically update the `schema.graphql` file for you. This crucial step ensures that gql.tada will have access to the most current and accurate version of the GraphQL schema, allowing your application to function correctly with the latest data structures and relationships defined within your DatoCMS setup.

## Next 14? But I want Next 15!

[Next 15 requires React 19](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/version-15#react-19), which is currently in Release Candidate status as of today. Vercel aims to incorporate cutting-edge features in their releases, as this aligns with their vision for Next.js. To ensure maximum "production readiness," we advise exercising caution and waiting a bit longer before recommending that our users transition to React 19.

If you are inclined to experiment with the latest developments, you are welcome to begin with this starter and execute the codemods as outlined in the [Next 14 to 15 migration guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/version-15#upgrading-from-14-to-15): we have tested this approach, and everything appears to function properly.

```
npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest
```
